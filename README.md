# asciinema-timing

Adjust timings in asciicast v2 files.

Currently only `--idle-time-limit` is implemented.  Useful when you've forgetten to specify that option when running `asciicast rec`, but you want to publish the resulting asciicast (with idle-time-limit applied) on https://asciinema.org/.  Just download the asciicast (v2 format), run it through this utility, and then upload it again.
